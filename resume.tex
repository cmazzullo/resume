    \mbox{\href{repository.niddk.nih.gov}{repository.niddk.nih.gov}}
    and \mbox{\href{neurobiobank.nih.gov}{neurobiobank.nih.gov}} using
    a stack based on Django, Elasticsearch, and PostgreSQL.
  \item Led the conversion of
    \mbox{\href{biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov}{biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov}} and
    \mbox{\href{repository.niddk.nih.gov}{repository.niddk.nih.gov}}
